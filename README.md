# **ENCE_3220_Class2023 Phase D**
Phase D of Embedded System tasked students to design their own PCB using the STM32f407G and the STM32CubeIDE. A friend of mine recently asked me if I could design a deivce that would help him monitor the temperature in his bearded dragon's enclosure. This project seemed like the perfect opportunity to begin designing such a device. 

## Project Requirements
The requirements for this temperature monitor aren't complex. The system must be able to read the current temperature, additional data is a plus. The system must also be able to display that data in a readable manner. The system must utilize the STM32F407G Discovery Board, and the software must be developed in the STM32CubeIDE. In summary, the system requirements are as follows: 
- Read temperature
- Display temperature in real time
- Utilize the STM32F407G Discovery Board
- Software developed in the STM32CubeIDE

## System Design
The design for this system includes the STM32F407G Discovery Board, an lcd display, and a temperature sensor. A block diagram of key components and their pin connections to the STM32F4.

## Components Selection
Key components for this system include the LCD1602A display, the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and the STM32F4 discovery board. A full list of the required components can be seen in the table below.
