# **ENCE_3220_Class2023 Phase D**
Phase D of Embedded System tasked students to design their own PCB using the STM32f407G and the STM32CubeIDE. A friend of mine recently asked me if I could design a deivce that would help him monitor the temperature in his bearded dragon's enclosure. This project seemed like the perfect opportunity to begin designing such a device.
